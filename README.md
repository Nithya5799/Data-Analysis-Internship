# Data Analysis Internship

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work completed during a Data Analysis Internship. The objective of this project was to apply data analysis techniques to real-world datasets, gain insights, and develop actionable conclusions using Python and popular data analysis libraries. The work includes data preprocessing, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling.

## Key Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were:
1. To explore and preprocess raw datasets for analysis.
2. To conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and uncover meaningful insights.
3. To build and evaluate predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
4. To document findings and provide actionable insights.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**
   - Import and load data into Python.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Perform data transformations and feature engineering.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Create visualizations to identify trends, outliers, and patterns.
   - Use statistical analysis to derive correlations and distributions.

4. **Model Development**
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification).
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools and Libraries
The project utilized the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning.
  - `jupyter`: For running and sharing notebooks.

## Results and Insights
- Highlight key insights from the data analysis (e.g., trends, patterns, and actionable findings).
- Summary of model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
